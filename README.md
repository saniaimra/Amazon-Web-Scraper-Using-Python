This project is a Python-based Amazon Web Scraper that automates the process of tracking product prices. It continuously scrapes Amazon every few minutes to monitor the price of a specified T-shirt. If the price drops below a user-defined budget, the program instantly triggers an email notification to alert the user. The scraper leverages Python libraries for web scraping, scheduling, and email handling, making it a lightweight yet effective tool for price tracking and alert automation.
